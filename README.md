## ‼️Important Information:
The package it self is a tool help you quickly check differences between quantity fulfill with quantity in work order creation.
But it **is your responsibilities** to download and provide data **CORRECTLY**

🔗 Below are two links, already set up in Netsuite, for the data set of workorder and fulfillment. I suggest using my dataset if you don't have a well set up one:
- **IF**: [Item fullfilment dataset](https://5574610.app.netsuite.com/app/common/search/searchresults.nl?searchid=2243&whence=)
- **WO**: [Work order dataset](https://5574610.app.netsuite.com/app/common/search/searchresults.nl?searchid=2637&whence=)

👍 Rule of thumbs on how to get the proper dataset:
1. Determine the period you want to reconcile, if that period is already closed. Have no worries to get all the data within that period.
1. If the period is not closed, if your current date is ahead of the end date of that period +2, you can get all the data within that period.
1. Otherwise, you need to get the data from the start date of that period to the current date -1.
